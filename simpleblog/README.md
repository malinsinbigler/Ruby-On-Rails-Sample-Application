# README

This project was a good introduction to a basic CRUD application utilizing the Ruby On Rails framework.


Some areas of interest that will be researched in a future tutorial will be:

* Actual user authentication
* Routing - rails seems to implicitly resolve many routes based on name. How can more complex routes, like an API, be set up?
* Active Record
* Action View
* Integration of a front-end JS framework such as Vue
* Additional steps to the build workflow (Webpack, etc...)
* Making and distributing custom gems
